# Hate Crimes Analysis
I conceptualized this personal project back in January 2020. In this project, I'll analyze hate crimes trends for Austin against the entire USA from 2017 to present. In particular, I'm focusing on the affects of hate crime against the LGBT community. 

## 6/11/2020

So far, I've reached the following findings which are included in the aus_final workbook: 

### Anti-lgbt oriented hate crimes accounted for 35.85% of all reported hate crimes, in Austin, TX, between 2017 and present. 
#### By year, of the total amount of reported hate crimes, anti-lgbt occurrences accounted for:
##### 29.41% in 2017
##### 26.32% in 2018
##### 41.67% in 2019
##### 60% for the present, so far

These are disturbing figures but the project is still incomplete... :( 

For this project I am utilizing datasets from data.austintexas.gov, the FBI, and I may include other data sources at a later time. 

Hope y'all find it as exciting and revealing as I have and I certainly welcome any collaborators, advice, critique, etc!
