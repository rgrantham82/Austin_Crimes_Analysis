# Hate Crimes Analysis
I conceptualized this project beginning in  January 2020. The goal is to analyze hate crimes trends for Austin, TX, from 2017 to present. In particular, I'm focusing on the affects of hate crime on the LGBT community. 

So far, I am using datasets provided by the Austin PD's publicly available databases, found at data.austintexas.gov. 

Originally, my plan was to complete this project solely in Python. The final product for the Austin portion, however, included such a small dataset that I decided to complete the analysis part in Excel. (DUCKS FOR COVER!!!) :D just kidding...I hope :P 

So far, I've reached the following findings which are included in the excel workbook: 

## **Update -- 6/27/2020**
### Presentl,y Anti-LGBT motivated hate crimes, in Austin, TX, account for 32.14% of all reported incidents starting in 2017. 
#### By year, of the total amount of reported incidents, anti-lgbt occurrences accounted for:
##### 29.41% in 2017
##### 30% in 2018
##### 36.36% in 2019
##### 37.50% for the year 2020 so far

Evidently, the rate of incidents motivated by Anti-LGBT bias is rising every year. This is particularly alarming, coupled with the current Covid crisis and who knows how the pandemic will affect or stir already alarming rates scape-goating against several minority communities. 

Needless to say, stay safe everyone! I hope this project is insightful and, as always, I look forward to your review and/or critique and advice.
