# Hate_Crimes_Analysis
A pet-project analyzing hate crimes trends for Austin against the entire USA from 2017 to present. 
For this project I am utilizing datasets from Austin PD as well as from the FBI & may include other data sources at a later time. 

So far, I chose to breakdown the project into notebooks according to the different phases of the analysis. For example, Book1 includes only the wrangling part of the analysis, Book2 (will) contain(s) the cleaning phase, and so on. 

Hope y'all find it as exciting and revealing as I have and I certainly welcome any collaborators, advice, critique, etc.
